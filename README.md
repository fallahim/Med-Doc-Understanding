# Medical Document Understanding Repository

## Overview

This repository hosts a collection of tools and models for medical document understanding. It includes an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model for extracting text from medical documents, a Large Language Model (LLM) for analyzing the extracted text, and an API created using Gradio for easy access to the functionalities of the project.

## Features




- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for extracting text from medical documents.
- Large Language Model (LLM) for analyzing the extracted text.
- Gradio API for interacting with the models and tools.
